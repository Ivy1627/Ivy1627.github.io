									<h2>My journey</h2>
									<p>My journey has been one of exploration and discovery, navigating through diverse fields to find my true passion. I did my first bachelor in law in Shanghai International Studies University and exchanged to Leiden University for one semester. Then I worked as an intern in a law firm for half a year but realized that I want to do 
										something more analytical while having leeway for creativity. I came to the states as a neuroscience and math major, envisioning a path in computational neuroscience.
									</p>However, delving into the field, I recognized the paramount importance of coding and model-building over pure biological knowledge. Embracing this revelation, I discovered a deep affinity for coding and problem-solving, prompting a shift in focus towards a career path rich in analytical pursuits and creative outlets. Through internships and self-exploration, I uncovered a passion for leveraging quantitative skills in dynamic environments, seeking opportunities that challenge and inspire growth. Today, I stand ready to embark on new challenges, eager to contribute to impactful projects that blend analytical rigor with innovative thinking.<p>

									<h2>Undergrad RA experience</h2>
									<p>I worked for one year at OSU Sullivian lab, which develop the datasets and the experimental and informatics approaches needed to “see” viruses in the oceans, soils, extreme environments, and humans.</p>
									<p>I helped develop viral ecology tools used for identification, classification, and analysis of viruses using Numpy.Perform containerization using Apptainer/Docker in UNIX environment and integrate the images into CyVerse and Ohio State Supercomputer.</p>

									<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
									<p>Beyond the realm of code and algorithms, I find solace and inspiration in the visual arts. Photography allows me to capture fleeting moments, while sketching and crafts serve as creative outlets for self-expression. Designing posters allows me to blend imagery and typography to convey powerful messages. With a keen eye for aesthetics and a passion for UI design, I strive to create visually compelling and intuitive user experiences that resonate with audiences. Through the fusion of technology and creativity, I seek to craft experiences that leave a lasting impact and evoke emotion.
